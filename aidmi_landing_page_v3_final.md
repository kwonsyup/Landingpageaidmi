## Trust Strip

Co-designed with US behavioral health clinicians from:

---

## Problem Section

**Headline:**  
Your notes are a filing cabinet. Your brain does all the work.

**Body:**  
Before every session, the same scramble. Skimming old notes. Trying to remember: *What did we adjust last time? When did the panic attacks start? Did I follow up on that job situation?*

Your current tools store information. They don't surface it when you need it.

AidMi is different. It synthesizes your client's history into a brief you can scan in 30 seconds. It answers questions across months of sessions — with citations. Longitudinal context for every client.

---

## Core Value Props Section

**Headline:**  
World's best clinical resident.

**Subheadline:**  
An assistant who reads every note, tracks every trend, and preps your chart before you walk in the room. That's AidMi.

---

### 1. Today's Brief

*Walk into every session prepared.*

Before each appointment, AidMi generates a brief: what changed since last visit, symptom trends, medication updates, open threads to revisit. Scan it in 30 seconds. Walk in ready.

---

### 2. Aimé

*Ask anything. Get answers with proof.*

"When did we first discuss the insomnia?" "What medications have we tried?" Aimé searches across every session and returns answers with citations. Like a research assistant for every client.

---

### 3. Evidence-Backed Notes

*Documentation you can defend.*

Every claim in your note links directly to the source. Click to verify. If evidence is missing, we flag it. No second-guessing. Sign with confidence.

---

## How It Works Section

**Headline:**  
From session to signed note in 2 minutes.

---

**Step 1: Capture**  
Start your in-person or telehealth session. AidMi transcribes in real-time with speaker separation.

**Step 2: Sign**  
End the session. Your note appears — fully drafted, with every clinical claim linked to the source. Verify with a click. Edit if needed. Sign.

**Step 3: Context Builds**  
Each signed note updates your client's profile. Today's Brief evolves. Aimé gets smarter. Your clinical intelligence compounds.

---

## Use Cases Section

**Headline:**  
Built for how you actually practice.

---

### For Psychiatrists

High-volume, short sessions. You need to know what changed and what to refill — fast. Today's Brief gives you the snapshot. Aimé answers the edge cases. Finish documentation in the 2 minutes between appointments, not after hours.

### For Psychologists

Deep therapeutic work that spans months. Track treatment progress without re-reading every note. Let AidMi remember the threads so you can stay present in the room.

### For Therapists

Rapport is everything. AidMi captures the details that build connection — the sister's name, the job interview, the vacation that helped. Start every session exactly where you left off.

---

## Social Proof Section

## FAQ Section

**Headline:**  
Questions? We've got answers.

---

**Is the Free plan really unlimited?**

Yes. Unlimited sessions and unlimited notes. We charge for speed and advanced continuity features (full longitudinal history, unlimited Aimé queries) — not per patient or per session.

---

**What happens to my recordings?**

Audio is deleted immediately after transcription. We never store recordings. Transcripts are retained to power citations, Today's Brief, and Aimé — but you can configure retention settings (auto-delete after signing, after X days, etc.).

---

**Does AidMi work with my current EHR?**

Yes. AidMi works alongside SimplePractice, TherapyNotes, Valant, and other EHRs. One-button to paste your signed note into your existing system, or use it standalone.

---

**Is it HIPAA compliant?**

Yes. AidMi is HIPAA compliant with a BAA included on all plans — including Free. Data is encrypted in transit and at rest.

---

**Do you train your AI on my patient data?**

No. Your client data is siloed, stored securely, and only used to power your clinical intelligence — Today's Brief, Aimé, and citations.

---

**How accurate are the AI notes?**

Every claim in your note links to the source in the transcript. Click to verify. If evidence is missing, we flag it as "Needs confirmation." You review and sign — nothing goes into the chart without your approval.
